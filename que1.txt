1. List out the features of HTML5.

Answer:
Some of the most important features of HTML5 are:

New semantic elements: HTML5 introduces a number of new semantic elements, such as header, footer, section, and article. These elements help to make web pages more accessible and easier to understand for both humans and machines.

Audio and video: HTML5 introduces native support for audio and video, which means that you can embed these media types in your web pages without the need for third-party plugins.

Canvas: HTML5 also introduces the canvas element, which is a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive graphics.

Forms: HTML5 introduces a number of new features for forms, such as the ability to validate form input and the ability to submit forms using Ajax.

Web Workers: HTML5 introduces web workers, which are a way to run code in the background. This can be useful for tasks that are CPU-intensive or that require long periods of time to complete.
