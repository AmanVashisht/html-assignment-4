<!-- Create a simple webpage with semantic HTML which has the header, main, and footer sections. The 
header section must contain links to navigate to different sections of the webpage. The main section 
must contain three subsections about what is HTML. What is semantic HTML and a list of commonly used 
semantic tags? In the end, the footer section must contain your name -->

        <p>
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to create and structure web pages. It forms the backbone of the World Wide Web and defines the structure, content, and presentation of documents. HTML is not a programming language; rather, it is a markup language that uses tags or elements to annotate different parts of a document, indicating their structure and how they should be displayed. 
            HTML allows developers to create headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, images, links, and more. These elements provide the building blocks for creating rich and interactive web pages. HTML documents consist of tags represented by angle brackets, such as <tag>, and are typically written in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag enclosing content. <br>
            Web browsers interpret and render HTML documents, converting the markup into visually rendered web pages. HTML is continuously evolving, with new versions introducing new features, elements, and APIs to enhance the capabilities of web pages. 
            In summary, HTML is a foundational language for web development, providing the structure and content of web pages. It enables developers to create interactive, accessible, and visually appealing websites that can be accessed across different devices and platforms.

            Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup elements that convey meaning and structure to both browsers and developers. It is an approach to HTML coding that focuses on using tags that accurately describe the purpose and content of the elements they enclose.
            In semantic HTML, instead of using generic or presentational tags like <div> or <span> for every element, developers opt for more specific and meaningful tags. 

            By using semantic tags, developers improve the accessibility, maintainability, and search engine optimization of their web pages. Screen readers and assistive technologies rely on semantic HTML to provide accurate information to users with disabilities. Search engines can better understand the structure and content of a page, leading to improved search rankings and visibility. <br>
            Semantic HTML also benefits developers by making the code more readable and understandable. It provides a clear structure and purpose to different sections of the page, making it easier to navigate and maintain. Semantic tags also make it easier to apply CSS styles and layout, as they have inherent meaning that can be leveraged by styling frameworks.
            Overall, semantic HTML promotes best practices in web development by focusing on meaningful and descriptive tags. It enhances accessibility, search engine optimization, code readability, and maintainability. By using semantic HTML, developers can create more accessible, well-structured, and future-proof web pages
